# Contributing to [AirBnB_clone]

Welcome to the contribution guide for [AirBnB_clone]! We appreciate your interest in helping us improve our project. Here's how you can get started:

## Cloning the Repository

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository page.

2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command (replace `[your-username]` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[project-name].git
   ```

3. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd [project-name]
   ```

## Creating a Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch to work on. This helps keep your changes isolated from the main codebase.

1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name. For example, if you're fixing a bug, you might name your branch `fix/bug-description`. Use dashes to separate words:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

## Making Changes

1. Make the necessary changes to the codebase using your preferred code editor.

2. Test your changes to ensure they work as expected.

## Committing Changes

1. Stage your changes for commit:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Brief description of the changes"
   ```

## Pushing Changes and Creating a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin fix/bug-description
   ```

2. Visit the original repository on GitHub and you will see a prompt to create a pull request from your branch.

3. Provide a clear and concise title and description for your pull request. Explain what changes you made and why they are necessary.

4. Submit the pull request.

## Review and Merge

Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may ask for additional changes or provide feedback. Once the changes are approved, your pull request will be merged into the main project.
